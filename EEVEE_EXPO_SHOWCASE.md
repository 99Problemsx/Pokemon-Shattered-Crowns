## Story

You are a young trainer from the quiet town of Dawnhaven Village. Your journey begins like any other—choosing your first Pokemon, saying goodbye to your parents, stepping onto Route 1.

But you are not ordinary.

A strange mark appears on your skin. Visions haunt your dreams. And an ancient power stirs within you.

You are one of three Chosen—mortals bound to legendary guardians tasked with protecting the world from an ancient evil sealed away long ago. Together with Lyra, a kind-hearted healer bound to Xerneas, and Kael, a troubled young man with a dark past bound to Yveltal, you must uncover the truth behind the Shattered Crowns and stop the primordial beast Nidhoggr from consuming all existence.

But the path is not easy. Allies will fall. Enemies may become friends. And you will have to decide what—and who—you are willing to sacrifice to save everything.

## Development

Pokemon Shattered Crowns has been a labor of love. The focus from day one was creating a Pokemon game where story matters—where you care about the characters, where deaths mean something, where the ending feels earned.

The script alone contains over 19,000 lines of story content.

Every chapter was crafted to move the plot forward while developing characters and relationships. The goal was to create something that feels like a complete JRPG experience within the Pokemon framework.
