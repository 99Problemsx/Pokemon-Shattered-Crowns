- **\Player**: Dad does. They collaborated on research years ago.  
- **\Player**: Before Dad became Champion, he was a researcher too.  
- **Kael**: Wait—your father is Champion Marcus?  
- **Kael**: THE Marcus?  
- **\Player**: *sheepishly* I... don't like to bring it up.

- **Lyra**: What do you mean, 'Gnawing One'?  
- **Lyra**: I thought you served Hoopa!  
- **Dread**: *laughs*  
- **Dread**: Hoopa? That chaos trickster is merely a key.  
- **Dread**: The lock it opens... is far more terrifying.  
- **Dread**: Nidhoggr, the World-Eater.  
- **Dread**: Soon it shall rise...  
- **Dread**: And this world will be consumed.  

#### Scene: Chapter 18 dread battle (`ch18_dread_battle`)
- **\Player**: We won't let that happen!

- **Dread**: You cannot truly defeat me.  
- **Kael**: Watch us try.  
- **Dread**: Oh, but I'm not here to win today.  
- **Dread**: I'm here to learn.  
- **Lyra**: Learn what?  
- **Dread**: Your weaknesses. Your limits.  
- **Dread**: How far your Guardian bonds extend.

- **Lyra**: Malachar... the High Priest.  
- **Lyra**: So there's someone above even Viktor.  
- **Kael**: And he called Hoopa a 'key.'  
- **Kael**: Which means the true threat is behind that door.  
- **\Player**: Nidhoggr.  
- **\Player**: The Gnawing One from the temple records.  
- **Kael**: A chaos entity older than the Guardians.  
- **Kael**: The temples described it as the End of All Things.  
- **Lyra**: So Hoopa's prison...  
- **Lyra**: Is also Nidhoggr's prison?  
- **Kael**: It makes sense. Hoopa's power bends reality.  
- **Kael**: That power could free something even greater.  
- **\Player**: Then we're not just stopping a jailbreak.  
- **\Player**: We're stopping the apocalypse.

- **\Player**: Whatever comes next, we face together.  
> *Your marks pulsed in unison.*  
> *The Guardians approved of your determination.*  
- **Kael**: We should contact Dad Marcus.  
- **Kael**: He might know about Malachar.  
- **\Player**: Good idea. But first...  
- **\Player**: There's still a Gym ahead.  
- **Lyra**: Right! We can't forget the badges.  
- **Lyra**: We need them to reach the League.

### Chapter 19: The Trail - Planning the Shard Hunt

#### Scene: Chapter 19 contacting professor (`ch19_contacting_professor`)
> *After the encounter with Dread, you contacted Professor Aldric.*  
> *His face appeared on the video call, concerned.*  
- **Professor Aldric**: I've been researching what you told me.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Malachar, the High Priest.  
- **Professor Aldric**: And Nidhoggr... the Gnawing One.  
- **\Player**: What did you find?  
- **Professor Aldric**: Come to my research station.  
- **Professor Aldric**: This conversation should be in person.  
- **Professor Aldric**: What I've discovered... is troubling.  
- **Lyra**: That doesn't sound good.  
- **Kael**: It never is.  
> *The call ended.*  
> *You set off immediately.*  

#### Scene: Chapter 19 professor briefing (`ch19_professor_briefing`)
> *Professor Aldric spread ancient maps across his desk.*  
> *His research station was cluttered with texts and artifacts.*  
- **Professor Aldric**: Based on your findings and my research...  
- **Professor Aldric**: The guardian shards are in three locations.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Eternal Forest. Mortality Ruins. The Blade Shrine.  
- **Kael**: Each tied to a different Guardian.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Correct.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Eternal Forest for Xerneas, Guardian of Life.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Mortality Ruins for Yveltal, Guardian of Death.  
- **Professor Aldric**: The Blade Shrine for Zacian, Guardian of Valor.  
- **Lyra**: The cult knows this too?  
- **Professor Aldric**: Almost certainly.  
- **Professor Aldric**: You must reach the shards before they do.  
- **Professor Aldric**: If they corrupt even one...  

#### Scene: Chapter 19 shard explanation (`ch19_shard_explanation`)
- **\Player**: What exactly are these shards?  
- **Professor Aldric**: Fragments of the original seal.

- **Professor Aldric**: They created three anchor points.  
> *He pointed to the map.*  
- **Professor Aldric**: Each shard strengthens the seal.  
- **Professor Aldric**: But they also serve as... backup keys.  
- **Kael**: So the cult could use them to free Nidhoggr?  
- **Professor Aldric**: Worse.  
- **Professor Aldric**: They could corrupt the shards.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Turn the seal into a doorway.  
- **Lyra**: That's... really bad.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Your Guardian connections protect the shards.  
- **Professor Aldric**: You must reach them, purify them, strengthen them.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Only then will the seal hold.  

#### Scene: Chapter 19 route planning (`ch19_route_planning`)

- **Kael**: We might as well collect the badge.

- **\Player**: Seventh badge, then the forest.  
- **\Player**: Sounds like a plan.  
- **Professor Aldric**: Be careful out there.

> *Outside the Gym, you regrouped.*  
- **Lyra**: Just one more badge after this!
